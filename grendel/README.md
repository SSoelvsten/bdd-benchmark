# Grendel
This folder contains the generation of shell scripts, with which one can run the
benchmarks on the GRENDEL-S cluster running the SLURM queueing system at [CSCAA,
Aarhus University](http://www.cscaa.dk/). Since _Adiar_ makes use of disk, then
one needs to use the newly acquired _q48_ nodes with 3.0 GHz CPUs, 384 GB of
memory, and 3.5 TB of SSD disk available for temporary files in a _scratch/_
directory.

## Generating the .sh scripts

All shell scripts used on the cluster are generated by the Python 3 script in
`grendel_gen.py`

```bash
module load python
python3 grendel_gen.py
```

Alternatively, you can use the Makefile, which both includes a _build_ and a
_clean_ target.

```bash
ml load python && make
```

## Running the .sh scripts

To compile all the benchmarks for the desired CPU (i.e. with the correct
instruction set), we provide the `grendel_build.sh` script that can be run on
one of the desired nodes in question. This can be run from the root directory as
follows:

```bash
sbatch -p q48 grendel/build.sh
```

You can follow the build process with `tail -f slurm-<jobid>.out` .

When the build is complete, then you can schedule all the generated shell files
from the root directory of this repository with

```bash
for f in grendel/*_*_*.sh; do sbatch -p q48 $f; done
```

Or with `grendel/<package>_*_*.sh` or `grendel/*_<benchmark>_*.sh` one
can schedule only a particular subset of them to be run. The output of these
runs will be appended to files at `/out/<benchmark>/<package>/<instance>.out`.

## Checking Current Jobs

To see the full list of all your jobs including the full name of each job, run
the following command.

```bash
squeue --me --format "%i  %t   %j" 
```

## Download Output to your Local Machine

Assuming you have a copy of the repository in the `~/bdd_benchmark/` folder with the results from the job scripts in this folder stored in `~/bdd_benchmark/out` (default), then you can download all the data to your local machine with the following command:

```bash
scp -r {username}@grendel.cscaa.dk:bdd-benchmark/out/ .
```
